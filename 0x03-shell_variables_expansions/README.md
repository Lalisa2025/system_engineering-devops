<pre> # 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions ## üìå Project Overview This project is part of the **ALX System Engineering DevOps** curriculum. It focuses on the **shell environment**, including initialization files, environment variables, local variables, and variable expansions. By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in: - Creating and using **aliases** - Understanding **environment vs local variables** - Modifying the **PATH** - Counting directories in `$PATH` - Performing **arithmetic operations** using variables - Using **shell expansions** like addition, division, and exponentiation --- ## üìÇ Project Directory Structure All scripts are located in: ```bash 0x03-shell_variables_expansions/ ``` --- ## üõ†Ô∏è Task List | File | Description | |-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------| | `0-alias` | Creates an alias named `ls` to run `rm *` | | `1-hello_you` | Prints `hello` followed by the current user | | `2-path` | Appends `/action` to the end of the PATH | | `3-paths` | Counts the number of directories in `$PATH` | | `4-global_variables` | Prints environment variables | | `5-local_variables` | Prints local variables, environment variables, and functions | | `6-create_local_variable` | Creates a local variable `BEST="School"` | | `7-create_global_variable` | Creates a global variable `BEST="School"` | | `8-true_knowledge` | Adds `128` to the value of the `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` variable | | `9-divide_and_rule` | Divides `POWER` by `DIVIDE` and prints the result | | `10-love_exponent_breath` | Raises `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE` | --- ## ‚úÖ How to Run Each file is a shell script and can be run like this: ```bash chmod +x filename ./filename ``` Some scripts require environment variables. You can set them using: ```bash export VAR_NAME=value ``` Example: ```bash export TRUEKNOWLEDGE=1209 ./8-true_knowledge ``` --- ## üìé Author **Lalisa Abebe Geleta** [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Lalisa2025) --- ## üß† Skills Learned - Shell initialization files: `.bashrc`, `.profile` - `export` vs normal assignment - Shell arithmetic: `+`, `/`, `**` - Scripting best practices </pre>
