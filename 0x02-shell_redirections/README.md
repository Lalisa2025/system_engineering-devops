# 0x02. Shell Redirections

This directory contains solutions for the ALX Shell project **0x02-shell_redirections**.  
The tasks focus on shell scripting involving output redirections and file manipulations.

## Files

- **0-hello_world**: Prints "Hello, World" followed by a new line.
- **6-third_line**: Displays the third line of the file `iacta`.
- **7-file**: Creates a file named `*'"Best School"'*$?*****:)` containing the text `Best School`.
- **9-duplicate_last_line**: Duplicates the last line of the file `iacta`.

## Usage

Make sure the file `iacta` is present in the directory before running scripts that require it.

Run scripts with:
```bash
./0-hello_world
./6-third_line
./7-file
./9-duplicate_last_line
