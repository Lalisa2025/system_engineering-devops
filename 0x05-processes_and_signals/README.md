# 0x05. Processes and Signals

This project is an introduction to Linux processes and signals.

## Tasks Covered

- Displaying PID of current process
- Listing system processes with hierarchy
- Filtering and extracting Bash process PIDs
- Writing infinite loops
- Sending and handling signals like SIGTERM
- Killing processes via scripts

All scripts are written in Bash and use common process management tools such as `ps`, `kill`, `grep`, and `trap`.
